# Undergrad-Penetration-Test-Report
Repo for information about my penetration test report using Kali Linux
# PROJECTNAME

## Objective
The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive penetration test on a simulated Linux-based system to identify vulnerabilities and assess current security posture. I conducted reconnaissance using Nmap and leveraged the information to exploit vulnerabilities using Kali Linux, Hydra, and Metasploit. I successfully escalated privilege, gaining access to plaintext username and passwords. I conveyed my findings in a documented report that mapped findings to NIST SP 800-53 controls and included recommended remediation techniques. This project tested my skills in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and security reporting.
