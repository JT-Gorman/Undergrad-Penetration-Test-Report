# Undergrad Penetration Test Report

## Objective
The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive penetration test on a simulated Linux-based system to identify vulnerabilities and assess current security posture. I conducted reconnaissance using Nmap and leveraged the information to exploit vulnerabilities using Kali Linux, Hydra, and Metasploit. I successfully escalated privilege, gaining access to plaintext username and passwords. I conveyed my findings in a documented report that mapped findings to NIST SP 800-53 controls and included recommended remediation techniques. This project tested my skills in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and security reporting. 


### Skills Learned
- **Ethical hacking** - learned and applied ethical hacking techniques to simulate real world attacks and assess system security in a controlled environment
- **Vulnerability assessment** - identified security weaknesses using scanning and enumeration tools, prioritizing them based on potential impact
- **Technical writing** - wrote a clear, structured report mapping my findings to NIST security controls and recommending remediation strategies based on the uncovered vulnerabilities
- **Problem solving** - strategically planned attacks, interpreted results, and adapted approaches to overcome system defenses

### Tools Used
- Kali Linux - Linux distribution used for offensive security techniques such as penetration testing and digital forensics 
- Hydra - password cracking tool used in offensive security exercises, such as penetration tests, to grab passwords through brute force attacks
- Metasploit - exploitation framework that serves as a knowledge base of known exploits
- Nmap - network reconnaissance tool that scans systems, devices, and networks for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities
